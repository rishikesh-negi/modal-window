# modal-window
This is a simple modal window pop-up functionality project built as part of learning Event Handlers and handling key-press events in JavaScript. It also shows how to implement the functionality which lets user close the modal pop-up upon clicking outside the popup area, and also close it after pressing the 'Esc' key.
